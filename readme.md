# Jekyll + Foundation CSS #

I love Zurb's Foundation framework, and Jekyll is a great tool for preventing code duplication while building static HTML/CSS/js websites.

This tool really just exists to create a "base" directory for starting new projects.

## What's Included: ##
* all the directories that Jekyll needs to compile your static site
* the foundation framework (css/js/images)
* a default html5 template in _layouts
* a default nav bar under _includes
* orbit slideshow js code in _includes, ready to be called on any page
* default index and 404 page, along with 3 other empty pages


## How To Use It ##
Just download the .zip or

	```git clone git://github.com/groovemonkey/jekyll-foundation-base.git```

this baby and get started!

I hope this is useful to someone else as well, it has certainly made me more productive.

Cheers!
